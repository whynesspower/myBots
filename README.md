# myBots
This repository contains code files to the bots that I created for various platforms like Instagram, Discord, Reddit, Telegram 

Most the bots are created using python and Javascript APIs of differenct services. 

# what does my discord's bot do?

My Discord bot uses Discord's API to connect to its developer's platform and further uses Reddit's and Zenquotes API to fetch data from their sites and provide it to discod's chat boxes. 

    1.  It auto detects when are teens using curse words in chat and tells them not to do so with a random generated inspirational quote fetched from Zenquotes.com
    2.  It uses pyjokes as a libraby and tells user a joke when you user uses the $joke command
    3.  It servers as a personal assitant to me, so whenever you tag me in your messages, my bot tells what I am doing right now and some details on how to contact me (the                 creator)
    4.  Very soon a meme feature will be added to the bot,  which will fetch memes from reddit r/funnymemes using their public API.
    5.  You can add the bot to your server using this link https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=836440627327664148&permissions=2184703552&scope=bot
