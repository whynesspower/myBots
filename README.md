# myBots
This repository contains code files to the bots that I created for various platforms like Instagram, Discord, Reddit, Telegram 

Most the bots are created using python APIs of differenct services. My Discord bot uses Discord's API to connect to its developer's platform and further uses Reddit's and Zenquotes API to fetch data from their sites and provide it to discod's chat box. 
# what does my discord's bot do?
    1.  It auto detects when are teens using curse words in chat and tells them not to do so with a random generated inspirational quote fetched from Zenquotes.com
    2.  It uses pyjokes as a libraby and tells user a joke when you use the $joke command
    3.
